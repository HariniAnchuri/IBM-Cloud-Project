# IBM-Cloud-Project
This project is a machine learning-based system that detects different types of cyber-attacks in network traffic, like DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R. Itâ€™s trained on a public dataset from Kaggle and helps identify whether network activity is normal or suspicious. The goal is to improve network security by catching threats early.
